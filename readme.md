## RECORD APP

**RECORD APP** is a lite social media and record cataloguing app that aims to provide for vinyl listeners the services that GoodReads provides book-loving users, LetterBoxd provides for cinephiles, etc. That is to say, the social aspect is secondary to the personal library/curation aspect - the focus is on simple, pleasing designs and artist/album data. Using Discogs API, **RECORD APP** will allow users to:
	-create a private account that will allow them access to a variety of features
	-OR just view album pages with no account.  
USER will include the ability to: 
	-curate a digital library of their vinyl collection
	-display favorites, user-made shelves, and recent activity
	-display a "now spinning" featured album
	-search for and add records from the Discogs database on an index page where the 4 squares were
	-visit show pages for albums and leave "liner notes", i.e. comments, plus see:
		-track lists
		-pressing info
		-picture
		-YouTube link(maybe)
		-link to discogs marketplace(maybe)
	-visit show pages for artist that will display:
		-artist info
		-discography
